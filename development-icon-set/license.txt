Hi there, 

Thank you for downloading! You can use this icon set as you like, both for personal and commercial purposes. Feel free to shoot me an email or a tweet when you use these icons in one of your projects, I'd love to see them out in 'the wild web'.

Do not (re)sell this work. Selling stuff that is free = bad karma.
